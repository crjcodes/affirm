# README

Affirm is a small project demonstrating that I have some familiarity with Rails, SASS, MVC, database, and Open Source API.  It's developed with Feature-Driven Development (FDD).

More details on this project can be found at my site, Codeonward.com, under https://codeonward.com/series/affirm/.

## Feature #1

The user selects a topic from a list and submits the list.

The submission returns a list of verses that match.
